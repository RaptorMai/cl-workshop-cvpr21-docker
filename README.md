# cl-workshop-cvpr21-docker

This repo will serve as the seed repo for the challenge, containing a docker-compose.yaml file that spins up the method and environment containers, as well as two subfolders: method and environment ("setting"), each with their own docker file. Participants only make changes to the methods folder/container and then upload that to the challenge and we pull this image from evalai, and run it against our own environment docker.
